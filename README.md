# Capston-Project-
A small retailer specializing in Classic cars, encounters challenges managing and analyzing sales data. Their sales team lacks a centralized system for data management and analysis. To tackle this, they plan to adopt a Business Intelligence (BI) tool like MySQL or Power BI to efficiently handle and analyze their sales data.

In Step 1 of our solution, I leveraged the power of MySQL to meticulously prepare and cleanse the vast repository of Classicmodels data. This involved meticulous data transformation processes to ensure accuracy and consistency, making it primed for in-depth analysis. Subsequently, I seamlessly imported this refined dataset into Power BI, a cutting-edge Business Intelligence tool renowned for its intuitive interface and robust analytical capabilities. Through this integration, our sales team and management were empowered with dynamic, interactive dashboards that offer unparalleled insights into our sales performance.

Moving forward to Step 2, I delved into the realm of advanced analytics using MySQL. Through the execution of sophisticated queries, creation of pivot tables, and establishment of views, I embarked on a journey to unearth hidden patterns and correlations within our sales data. My objective was clear - to extract actionable insights that could potentially revolutionize our sales strategies and bolster revenue generation.

By seamlessly merging the capabilities of MySQL and Power BI, I have laid the foundation for a transformative data-driven approach. Armed with comprehensive analytics and intuitive visualizations, Axon is poised to navigate the intricate landscape of Classic car retailing with newfound precision and agility.
